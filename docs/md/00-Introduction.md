# Introduction

In this project, we will explore a **MITM** (Man-in-the-Middle) attack on **WPA2-Enterprise** networks that **do not validate the CA** (Certificate Authority) certificate. This is exploiting the fact that the client does not validate the server's certificate, and the server does not validate the client's certificate. This is a common configuration in many enterprise networks, as it is easier to manage.
